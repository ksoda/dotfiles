# thoughtbot dotfiles

## Requirements

Set fish as your login shell:

    chsh -s $(which fish)

(Opt) Execute [the boot script](https://gist.github.com/ksoda/3e54c308da7176258c80)

## Install

Clone onto your laptop:

    git clone git://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

(Or, [fork and keep your fork
updated](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/keeping-a-github-fork-updated)).

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

    brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
    brew install rcm

Install the dotfiles:

    env RCRC=$HOME/dotfiles/rcrc rcup

After the initial installation, you can run `rcup` without the one-time variable
`RCRC` being set (`rcup` will symlink the repo's `rcrc` to `~/.rcrc` for future
runs of `rcup`). [See
example](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles/blob/master/rcrc).

This command will create symlinks for config files in your home directory.
Setting the `RCRC` environment variable tells `rcup` to use standard
configuration options:

- Exclude the `README.md`, `README-ES.md` and `LICENSE` files, which are part of
  the `dotfiles` repository but do not need to be symlinked in.
- Give precedence to personal overrides which by default are placed in
  `~/dotfiles-local`
- Please configure the `rcrc` file if you'd like to make personal
  overrides in a different directory

## Update

From time to time you should pull down any updates to these dotfiles, and run

    rcup

to link any new files and install new vim plugins. **Note** You _must_ run
`rcup` after pulling to ensure that all files in plugins are properly installed,
but you can safely run `rcup` multiple times so update early and update often!

## Make your own customizations

Create a directory for your personal customizations:

    mkdir ~/dotfiles-local

Put your customizations in `~/dotfiles-local` appended with `.local`:

- `~/dotfiles-local/aliases.local`
- `~/dotfiles-local/git_template.local/*`
- `~/dotfiles-local/gitconfig.local`
- `~/dotfiles-local/psqlrc.local` (we supply a blank `.psqlrc.local` to prevent `psql` from
  throwing an error, but you should overwrite the file with your own copy)
- `~/dotfiles-local/tmux.conf.local`
- `~/dotfiles-local/vimrc.local`
- `~/dotfiles-local/vimrc.bundles.local`

For example, your `~/dotfiles-local/aliases.local` might look like this:

    # Productivity
    alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

Your `~/dotfiles-local/gitconfig.local` might look like this:

    [alias]
      l = log --pretty=colored
    [pretty]
      colored = format:%Cred%h%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset
    [user]
      name = Dan Croak
      email = dan@thoughtbot.com

Your `~/dotfiles-local/vimrc.local` might look like this:

    " Color scheme
    colorscheme github
    highlight NonText guibg=#060606
    highlight Folded  guibg=#0A0A0A guifg=#9090D0

If you don't wish to install a vim plugin from the default set of vim plugins in
`.vimrc.bundles`, you can ignore the plugin by calling it out with `UnPlug` in
your `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`.

    " Don't install vim-scripts/tComment
    UnPlug 'tComment'

`UnPlug` can be used to install your own fork of a plugin or to install a shared
plugin with different custom options.

    " Only load vim-coffee-script if a Coffeescript buffer is created
    UnPlug 'vim-coffee-script'
    Plug 'kchmck/vim-coffee-script', { 'for': 'coffee' }

    " Use a personal fork of vim-run-interactive
    UnPlug 'vim-run-interactive'
    Plug '$HOME/plugins/vim-run-interactive'

To extend your `git` hooks, create executable scripts in
`~/dotfiles-local/git_template.local/hooks/*` files.

Your `~/dotfiles-local/vimrc.bundles.local` might look like this:

    Plug 'Lokaltog/vim-powerline'
    Plug 'stephenmckinney/vim-solarized-powerline'
